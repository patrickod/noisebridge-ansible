# Noisebridge Ansible

This repository contains ansible playbooks for various services deployed at [Noisebridge](https://noisebridge.net)

Currently Noisebridge has a lot of undocumented infrastructure. The intention of this repository is to update our existing infrastructure by deploying new instances provisioned by ansible, the intention being to make self-documenting playbooks for people to reference.

Over time this repository will grow to house more ansible roles as we document and redeploy yet more services.

## Services yet TODO:
 - [ ] mailserver 
 - [ ] mailing lists
 - [ ] mediawiki (complete with our existing plugins)
 - [ ] xmpp
 - [ ] mattermost ircd gateway
